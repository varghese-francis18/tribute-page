        <li>2006 November-Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of
          18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his
          team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the
          funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, "That is an act of great commitment to the

          tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament. His
          century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called "the
